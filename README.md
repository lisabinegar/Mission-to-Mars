# Mission-to-Mars

I modified a web app with information about Mars, and added four images of Mars hemispheres. I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. This also required I store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
